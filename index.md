## About Me

I’m a Ph.D. candidate of  <a href="https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/english/info/1085/1233.htm" target="_blank"> Surgery</a> in <a href="http://www.rjh.com.cn/" target="_blank"> Ruijin Hospital</a>, <a href="https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/english/" target="_blank"> Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine</a>, working under the mentorship of Prof.<a href="https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/english/info/1354/4143.htm" target="_blank"> Baiyong SHEN</a>. My research involves exploring the mechanism of the development of pancreatic cancer based on multi-omics.

Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I completed my master’s degree in Surgery from <a href="https://www.xy3yy.com" target="_blank">Third Xiangya Hospital</a>, <a href="https://www.csu.edu.cn/index.htm" target="_blank">Central South University </a> advised by Prof. <a href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/1213961/overview" target="_blank"> Xiao YU</a>. When I was a first-year postgraduate, I generated a serious interest in bioinformatics which is based on machine learning and mixed algorithms. Owing to my diligence and persistence, I am proficient in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank"> R </a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank"> Python </a>, and <a href="https://www.perl.org/" target="_blank"> Perl </a> script for high-throughput sequencing analysis, CRISPR functional gene screening, tumor immune model, and single-cell multi-omics analysis. What’s more, I have participated in the <a href="https://www.nsfc.gov.cn/" target="_blank">National Natural Science Foundation of China</a>, <a href="https://kjt.hunan.gov.cn/kjt/index.html" target="_blank">Hunan Natural Science Foundation</a>, and other scientific research projects. So far, I have published five SCI papers as the co-first author, and the total impact factor of the papers was over <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dongjie-Chen-10" target="_blank">50</a> .


<!-- and my bachelor’s degree in Clinical Medicine from <a href="https://www.hnucm.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> Hunan University of Chinese Medicine</a>. -->

Outside of academia,  I’m also passionate about singing and took part in the Top Ten Singers competition in our school. In addition, I am also interested in oil painting, and aeromodelling.
